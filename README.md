Noisy is a jQuery plugin that adds random noise to a given element.

#### Here's an example:
    $('body').noisy({
        intensity: 0.9, 
        size: 200, 
        opacity: 0.08,
        fallback: 'fallback.png',
        monochrome: false
    });

But since all parameters are optional you can just use it like this:
    $('body').noisy();

You can try the interactive demo [here](http://rappdaniel.com/other/noisy-sample/).

I'm just a poor student who did this on my spare time, if you like my script I'd love a few cents to my paypal :) (danielrappt@gmail.com)

If you don't like paypal for whatever reason, you can use flattr:
